Can be made up to 1 day ahead.",

Cover with a lid and cook for 1½ hrs, checking and stirring every 15-20 mins to prevent it from burning.",

           "STEP 1 \nMelt the butter and both sugars in a pan over a low heat, adding a pinch of salt if the butter is unsalted. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for 10 mins – this will stop the eggs from curdling when added. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter a 23cm square tin or 25 x 20cm baking tin and line with baking parchment.",
           "STEP 2 \nBeat the eggs and vanilla into the cooled butter and sugar mixture until well-combined. Sieve in the flour and baking powder, then gently fold until you have a smooth batter. Fold in the white chocolate, then scrape into the prepared tin. Smooth the top and bake for 40-45 mins until the edges are coming away from the sides of the tin, the top has a papery crust and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out with a few crumbs, but no liquid batter. The blondies will firm up as they cool.",
           "STEP 3 \nLeave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. The blondies will keep in an airtight container for three days."
